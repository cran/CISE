Description: Specific dimension reduction methods for replicated graphs 
    (multiple undirected graphs repeatedly measured on a common set of 
    nodes). The package contains efficient procedures for estimating 
    a shared baseline propensity matrix and graph-specific low rank 
    matrices. The algorithm uses block coordinate descent algorithm to 
    solve the model, which alternatively performs L2-penalized logistic 
    regression and multiple partial eigenvalue decompositions, as described 
    in the paper Wang et al. (2017) <arXiv:1707.06360>.
